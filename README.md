Need some advice please
I am working through a beginners coding book and am stuck. 
I should be able to click "Send Imaging Request" in the 1st picture and produce the pdf template in the 2nd picture, however I get an error page as shown in picture 3.
I have installed fpdi via Terminal to help me generate this pdf.
The two php documents I have been using are shown in pictures 4 and 5.
Any advice on where I'm going wrong would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Jamie
